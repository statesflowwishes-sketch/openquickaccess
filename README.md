# StatesFlowWishes · Z3r0CL0cK · sH1FTSyNc

A comprehensive state management system with precise timing and advanced synchronization capabilities.

## 🎯 Overview

This system integrates three core components:

- **StatesFlowWishes**: Advanced state flow management with customizable transitions and callback "wishes"
- **Z3r0CL0cK**: High-precision timing system with event scheduling and clock management
- **sH1FTSyNc**: Sophisticated synchronization framework for coordinating states, clocks, and processes

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Running the Demo

```bash
python3 main.py
```

### Running Tests

```bash
python3 tests.py
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from src import create_integrated_system, StateType

# Create integrated system
states_flow, zero_clock, shift_sync, temporal_manager = create_integrated_system()

# Create and manage states
states_flow.create_state("start", StateType.INITIAL, transitions=["processing"])
states_flow.create_state("processing", StateType.ACTIVE, transitions=["completed"])

# Add wishes (callbacks)
states_flow.add_wish("start_to_processing", lambda: print("Starting work..."))

# Control timing
zero_clock.start()
zero_clock.schedule_event("reminder", 5.0, lambda: print("5 seconds elapsed!"))

# Synchronize components
shift_sync.create_sync_point("workflow_sync", ["states_flow", "zero_clock"])
shift_sync.trigger_sync("workflow_sync")
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### StatesFlowWishes
- **State Management**: Create, transition, and track states with type safety
- **Flow Control**: Define allowed transitions between states
- **Wishes System**: Execute callbacks on state transitions
- **History Tracking**: Monitor flow progression and timing

### Z3r0CL0cK
- **Precise Timing**: High-resolution clock with pause/resume capabilities
- **Event Scheduling**: Schedule one-time or recurring events
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: Concurrent clock management
- **Real-time Callbacks**: Execute functions at specific times

### sH1FTSyNc
- **Multi-Component Sync**: Coordinate states, clocks, and custom participants
- **Sync Points**: Define synchronization checkpoints
- **Temporal Shifts**: Manage time-based synchronized operations
- **Callback System**: React to synchronization events

## 📋 Features

### State Flow Management
- ✅ Typed state system with validation
- ✅ Configurable state transitions
- ✅ Callback execution on transitions ("wishes")
- ✅ Flow history and duration tracking
- ✅ Real-time state monitoring

### Clock & Timing
- ✅ High-precision elapsed time tracking
- ✅ Pause/resume functionality
- ✅ Event scheduling system
- ✅ Recurring event support
- ✅ Thread-safe operations

### Synchronization
- ✅ Multi-participant synchronization
- ✅ Configurable sync tolerance
- ✅ Master clock coordination
- ✅ Temporal shift management
- ✅ Sync history tracking

## 🔧 System Integration

The three components work together seamlessly:

1. **States** can trigger **Clock** events during transitions
2. **Clock** events can cause **State** transitions
3. **Sync** coordinates both **States** and **Clocks**
4. **Temporal Shifts** manage time-based synchronized operations

## 🧪 Testing

The system includes comprehensive tests covering:
- State creation and transitions
- Clock timing accuracy
- Event scheduling and execution
- Synchronization mechanics
- Integrated system functionality

All tests pass with 100% success rate.

## 🎨 Example Use Cases

- **Workflow Management**: Coordinate complex multi-step processes
- **Game Development**: Manage game states with precise timing
- **System Orchestration**: Synchronize distributed components
- **Real-time Applications**: Time-critical state management
- **Process Automation**: Scheduled task coordination
